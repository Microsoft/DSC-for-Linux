Building the Desired State Configuration (DSC) Local Configuration Manager and Linux Resource Providers

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. At least one modern Linux system with:
    a. root login capability
    b. These build tools:
        i.  GNU Make
        ii. g++
        iii. Python version 2.5 or later, the package python-devel
    c. Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) 1.0.8. http://theopengroup.org/software/omi
        i. pam-devel
        ii. openssl-devel
    d. Build dependencies:
        i. (Ubuntu) libcurl4-openssl-dev


Building and installing the Local Configuration Manager and Linux Resource Providers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extract PSDSCLinux.tar into a directory that you will build it from.
2. Download and extract OMI 1.0.8 into a directory named "omi-1.0.8" in a directory parallel to the LCM and Providers directory.  The directory tree should look something like:

   ./configure
   ./LCM
   ./license.txt
   ./omi-1.0.8
   ./omi-1.0.8/agent
   ./omi-1.0.8/base
   ...

3. Building
   A. Configuring OMI and building
      i.  Configure OMI with desired options (refer to OMI documentation for this step).
        a. The default configuration installs to /opt/omi-1.0.8
         b. To use the default configuration, run: (cd omi-1.0.8 && ./configure)
      ii. Run: make
   B. Installing OMI:
      i.  Run: (cd omi-1.0.8 && sudo ./output/install)
   C. Registering the LCM + nxProviders with OMI:
      i.  Run: sudo make reg

4. Running OMI
   A. On the Linux system, run omiserver with environment variable OMI_HOME set to OMI's installed directory
      i.  Run as root: OMI_HOME=*PATH_TO_INSTALLED_OMI_DIR* *PATH_TO_INSTALLED_OMI_DIR*/bin/omiserver
      ii. The default installation for OMI 1.0.8 is "/opt/omi-1.0.8".  Thus, for default installations, part 4Ai above becomes:
            OMI_HOME=/opt/omi-1.0.8 /opt/omi-1.0.8/bin/omiserver
   B. Note: In order to run following reboots, it is recommended to configure OMI as a System-V, Upstart, or SystemD daemon 



To author DSC MOF configuration for Linux on a Windows computer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A Windows computer with:
    A. Adminstrative privileges
    B. Windows PowerShell (>=4.0)


1. Install the Linux Resource Provider MOF module:
   A. Extract the nx.zip file into %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\ such that the directory tree looks like:
      %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\nx\nx.psd1
      %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\nx\Readme.txt
      %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\nx\DSCResources
      %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\nx\DSCResources\MSFT_nxFileResource
      ...

   B. In order to compile a Configuration MOF that uses the DSC for Linux resources, use "Import-DscResource -Module nx" inside a DSC Configuration block.
   C. Example DSC Configuration blocks provided in the "Example DSCs" directory.
  
2. Managing a Linux system with DSC
   A. You need a compiled configuration MOF to apply a new configuration to a system.  Please refer to part 1 of this section, as well as the DSC for Windows documentation, for instructions on how to generate a configuration MOF.
   B. Once you have a MOF, you can apply it by running:
        Start-DscConfiguration -CimSession:$myCimSession -Path:"C:\path_to_compiled_mof_directory\" -Wait -Verbose
   C. You can get the current configuration of the system by running:
        Get-DscConfiguration -CimSession:$myCimSession
   D. You can test the current configuration of the system by running:
        Test-DscConfiguration -CimSession:$myCimSession
   E. For more information on creating a CimSession for use with the -CimSession parameter, see: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj590760.aspx

3. Notes
   A. More detail on errors can be found in the stderr/stdout of omiserver on the Linux system. For diagnostic purposes, omiserver can be run in a tty so that stderr/stdout are visible.
   B. The DSC Local Configuration Manager log can be found at $OMI_HOME/var/log/dsc.log
